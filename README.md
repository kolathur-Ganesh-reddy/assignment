# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project serves as a foundational template for building modern React applications using Vite and TypeScript. It is designed for educational and assignment purposes to demonstrate key concepts such as:

-Component-based architecture using React.

-Type safety and tooling with TypeScript.

-Efficient development experience using Vite's fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement).

-Scalable project structure that supports modular development and easy maintainability.

-Linting and code quality enforcement using ESLint with TypeScript support.

The template provides a ready-to-use development environment where students or developers can build features, explore React hooks, manage state, and integrate APIs.
